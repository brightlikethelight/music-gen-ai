# üéâ Docker Demo is Running!

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Docker is now running and your Music Generation Platform is operational! Here's what's working:

### ‚úÖ Services Running (4/5)
- **API Gateway** - ‚úÖ Healthy at http://localhost:8000
- **User Management** - ‚úÖ Healthy (registration, authentication working)
- **Audio Processing** - ‚úÖ Healthy (format conversion, analysis ready)
- **PostgreSQL** - ‚úÖ Running (user data storage)
- **Redis** - ‚úÖ Running (caching and queues)
- **Generation Service** - ‚è≥ Starting up (downloading MusicGen models ~2GB)

### ‚úÖ What's Working Now
1. **User Registration** - Successfully created accounts
2. **Authentication** - JWT tokens working
3. **API Health Checks** - All endpoints responsive
4. **Database Operations** - PostgreSQL storing user data
5. **Service Communication** - Microservices talking to each other

### ‚è≥ Generation Service Status
The generation service is downloading the MusicGen AI models from Hugging Face. This is a one-time download of approximately 2GB. Once complete, you'll be able to generate music!

## üöÄ How to Use the Demo

### Option 1: Interactive Demo (Recommended)
```bash
python3 demo.py demo
```
This will guide you through:
- Creating an account
- Generating music (once models are loaded)
- Creating playlists
- Exploring social features

### Option 2: Quick Test
```bash
python3 simple_test.py
```
This runs a quick system check.

### Option 3: Manual API Testing
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Register a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "musicfan",
    "email": "fan@example.com", 
    "password": "secure123"
  }'

# Use the token from registration to generate music (once ready)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Relaxing piano music",
    "duration": 30
  }'
```

## üìä Monitoring Progress

### Check Service Status
```bash
# See all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml ps

# Check generation service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs generation --tail 20

# Check overall health
curl http://localhost:8000/health/services | python3 -m json.tool
```

### When Will Generation Be Ready?
The MusicGen models take 5-10 minutes to download on first run. You'll know it's ready when:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health/services | grep generation
```
Shows `"status": "healthy"`

## üéµ What You Can Do While Waiting

1. **Explore the API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
2. **Create Multiple Users**: Test the registration system
3. **Check System Architecture**: Review the microservices design
4. **Read Documentation**: Check out DEMO_GUIDE.md

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Services Stop
```bash
# Restart all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml restart

# Or stop and start fresh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# All logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs

# Specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs user-management
```

## üéä Summary

Your enterprise music generation platform is running! The microservices architecture is working perfectly:
- ‚úÖ 4 core services operational
- ‚úÖ Databases connected
- ‚úÖ Authentication working
- ‚úÖ API responsive
- ‚è≥ AI models downloading (one-time process)

Once the models finish downloading, you'll have a complete music generation platform with:
- Text-to-music generation
- Multi-user support
- Playlist management
- Social features
- Professional API

**Enjoy your music generation platform!** üé∂
