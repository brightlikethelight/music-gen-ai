# üö® Critical Architecture Fix Required

## The Problem
We've been building MusicGen from scratch when we should be using Facebook's AudioCraft library with pre-trained models. This is like trying to rebuild GPT-4 instead of using the OpenAI API!

## The Solution: Use AudioCraft

### 1. Install the REAL MusicGen
```bash
pip install audiocraft
```

### 2. Working Implementation in 5 Lines
```python
from audiocraft.models import MusicGen

# This ACTUALLY works!
model = MusicGen.get_pretrained('facebook/musicgen-small')
model.set_generation_params(duration=30)
wav = model.generate(['happy birthday jazz style'])
```

## Why Current Approach is Flawed
- ‚ùå Custom transformer incompatible with T5 (768 vs 512 dims)
- ‚ùå Missing MusicGen's specific architecture
- ‚ùå No pre-trained weights for music
- ‚ùå Wrong tokenizer for audio
- ‚ùå Reinventing the wheel

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Install AudioCraft
2. Test real generation
3. Build features ON TOP of working foundation
4. Delete unnecessary custom implementation
